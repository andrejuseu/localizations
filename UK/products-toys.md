All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. Exploding Kittens is the most-backed crowd funded project ever, the most-funded game in the history of Kickstarter, and has paved the way for peace and tranquility in the modern world. Exploding Kittens is a card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.

### Dobble Card Game by Asmodée

Price: 13.45

Dobble is a speedy observation game where players race to match the identical symbol between cards. Reliant on a sharp eye and quick reflexes, Dobble creates excitement for children and adults alike while keeping every player involved in the action.
In Dobble, players compete with each other to find the matching symbol between one card and another. Every card is unique and has only one symbol in common with any other in the deck. The match can be difficult to spot as the size and positioning of the symbols can vary on each card. As the game is based on reactions and visual perception, rather than knowledge or strategy, there is no advantage for adults over children, making it the perfect family game.
Dobble is a series of quickness-based mini-games in which all players play at the same time. You can play the mini-games in a specific order, randomly, or you can keep playing the same one over and over. The only important thing is to have fun!
No matter which game you play, you always need to be the fastest to spot the identical symbol between two cards, name it out loud and then take the card, place it or discard it depending on the rules of the mini-game you’re currently playing.

- A game of speed, observation and reflexes
- Race to find the one matching image between one card and another
- Five mini games: Fill the Well, The Towering Inferno, Hot Potato, Catch Them All and The Poisoned Gift
